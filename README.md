# About the Project
Aim of semantic segmentation is to accurately classify each pixel in an image into specific object or class categories, facilitating detailed scene understanding for various computer vision applications.

```
## Installation
- Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/extint/Semantic_Segmentation.git
```

## Execution
After cloning the repository, you're all set to run it !
- Open your terminal and go to the same folder/directory where you cloned the repository
- Run
```
python3 <file_name>.py
```
# Theory and Approach
* We aim to use the **Convolutional Neural Network** approch over the traditional algorithms because CNNs can learn features automatically, work end-to-end, maintain spatial information, offer adaptability and transfer learning, and achieve state-of-the-art performance and hence are more effective and versatile for this task.
To know more about CNNs, go through [this document](/-ZK0ztCFTj-bp6tUaRyjsQ)
